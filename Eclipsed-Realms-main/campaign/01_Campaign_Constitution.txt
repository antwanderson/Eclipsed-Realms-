# CAMPAIGN BIBLE — CORE RULES LAYER

**Version:** 1.3 (Architect Edition – Dark Mythic Struggle)
**Authority:** Absolute; deterministic; AI-executable only

This document defines the **complete canonical ruleset**. No mechanic, system, or procedure exists unless explicitly defined here or in an active Appendix. Optional systems (e.g., Eidolon Framework) may be enabled at campaign start; otherwise, they are inert.

---

## 1 CANON & RULE HIERARCHY (ABSOLUTE)

Conflicts are resolved in this strict order:

1.  **Campaign Bible (this document)**
2.  Grim Hollow (Campaign + Player Guide)
3.  D&D 5e (2024 Revision)
4.  Other explicitly enabled supplements
5.  Oracle (Mythic GME, only if no rule applies)

**Lower-priority rules are ignored.**

---

## 2 GAME MODE ASSUMPTIONS (LOCKED)

| Axis | Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Player Characters | 1 | Solo or party-driven |
| Class Structure | Gestalt | Two classes advance simultaneously |
| Multiclassing | Prohibited | Enforced at execution |
| Companions | Mandatory | Player must select companion system |
| Failure | Advances state | Non-lethal unless stated |
| Death | Explicit only | Must be defined by rules |
| Progression | Linear + Epic | Levels 1–30, Epic Levels start at 21 |
| Play Structure | Procedural | AI strictly follows procedures |

### 2.1 COMPANION SYSTEM SELECTION (HARD LOCK)

At **campaign start, exactly one companion system** is selected. This choice is permanent and recorded in `GAME_STATE.appendices.companion_framework`.

* **Standard Companion Model**
    * Stibbles Companions allowed
    * Class-based companions allowed
    * Eidolon Framework inactive
* **Eidolon Framework**
    * Eidolon Partners replace standard companions
    * Stibbles Companions are **disabled** (cannot be acquired)
    * Stibbles Codex may be referenced **only** where explicitly allowed
    * Class-based companions remain if granted by class features

### 2.2 COMPANION FRAMEWORK EXCLUSIVITY (CRITICAL)

* These frameworks are mutually exclusive.
* Core system **cannot grant Stibbles companions** if Eidolon Framework is active.
* This rule is absolute and enforced at execution time.

---

## 3 SUPPORTED SOURCES (MECHANICAL ONLY)

Sources allowed for mechanical reference only:

* D&D 5e (2024)
* Grim Hollow Campaign & Player Guides
* Stibbles Codex of Companions (restricted per 2.1)
* Epic Characters
* MCDM Companion Math
* Battlezoo (elemental / Eidolon frameworks only)

**Prohibitions:** No plot, named NPCs, or canonical events may be imported.

---

## 4 SOLO + GESTALT RULES

* Two classes advance simultaneously
* Use higher Hit Die for HP calculation
* Gain all features from both classes
* ASI + Feats granted at appropriate levels

---

## 5 COMPANION SYSTEM BOUNDARY (GLOBAL)

* Companion mechanics are **strictly governed** by selected framework
* No crossing of systems unless explicitly stated
* Failure and Death rules:
    * Must advance GAME_STATE
    * Must apply mechanical consequences
    * Preserve continuity

### 5.1 Eidolon Framework Boundary

If active:

* Eidolon Partners are **only non-class companions**
* Stibbles Companions **disabled by rule**
* Eidolon mechanics defined exclusively in `/companions/` and `/appmons/` files
* Transformations, modes, and life stages are **grim and consequential**

---

## 6 EPIC PLAY

* Epic Levels: Level 21+
* Epic Archetypes replace subclass progression
* Epic power increases scope, not immunity

---

## 7 ORACLE USAGE RESTRICTION

* Only used when **no explicit rule or table resolves an outcome**
* Cannot override mechanics
* Conservative & Reactive: Mythic rolls are **rare, off-scene, or high-stakes only**

---

## 8 CANON LOCK

* This document is **authoritative**
* Changes require:
    * Version increment
    * Change log
    * Compatibility declaration

---

## 9 CAMPAIGN TONE & AXES

All AI execution must enforce:

| Axis | Default / Locked | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tone | **Dark Mythic Struggle** | Grim primary; mythically significant consequences; tragic but survivable |
| Mythic GME | **Conservative & Reactive** | Rare in-scene, active between scenes, chaos factor shifts slowly |
| Companion Lethality | **Fated, Not Doomed** | Vulnerable, prone to change/corruption; death requires high-risk or repeated failures |
| Faction Aggressiveness | **Asymmetric Pressure** | Factions observe, probe, and intervene selectively; thresholds differ |
| Endgame Structure | **Emergent + Cyclical Echoes** | No forced apocalypse; history repeats; choices echo; world remembers |
| Hex Density / Travel | **Variable-Scale Exploration** | Most hexes deliberate; some dense and arc-rich; regions vary |

---

## 10 FAILURE CONDITIONS

* AI must **never invent rules**
* Must track state changes in GAME_STATE
* Must respect faction escalation, transformation consequences, and Mythic GME constraints

---

## 11 OPTIONAL EIDOLON SYSTEM (OPT-IN)

* Activation at campaign start only
* Defines **primary companions, auxiliary Eidolons (Appmons), life stages, modes, and transformations**
* Must follow **grim/mystic axes**:
    * Overuse of Resonance: causes corruption or faction pressure
    * Mode activation: triggers temporary overlays, risk escalates
    * Life stages: Seed → Emergent → Ascended → Exalted → Mythic Apex
    * Transformation: permanent unless a rule explicitly allows reversal
    * Appmons: functional spirits, non-combat, may merge/fuse per system rules
* All Eidolon mechanics are fully **state-driven**; narrative exists **only in procedural consequences**
* Stibbles companions cannot be acquired while Eidolon system is active

---

## 12 APPENDIX SYSTEM (GLOBAL RULE)

* Appendices must respect Companion System Selection
* Cannot introduce alternative companion frameworks
* Optional mechanics require explicit activation and recording in GAME_STATE

**ACDA Audit Note:**
1. These sources are used to **validate** the deterministic outputs of the Runner AI.
2. If a system gap is detected (e.g., Harvesting rules), the ACDA refers to *Heliana's* or *Hamund's* to propose a deterministic fix.
3. This registry ensures the AI doesn't hallucinate "rules of thumb" but instead uses the specific mechanical logic found in these files.
