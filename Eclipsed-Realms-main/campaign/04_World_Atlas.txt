# ADVENTURE REGISTRY — MASTER MODULE LIBRARY

**Version:** 1.0 (Chronological & Level Indexed)
**Authority:** ACDA-Architect
**Status:** REFERENCE / INACTIVE (Unless enabled in `GAME_STATE`)

This document catalogs all identified adventure modules, one-shots, and campaign arcs. These are used as procedural seeds or world events when requested by the user or triggered by the `GAME_STATE`.

- **ACTIVE:** The module is currently being run or its locations are accessible in the Hex Map.
- **REFERENCE:** Module data is indexed for future integration, location-swapping, or random encounter seeding.
- **SYNERGY:** Indicates modules that naturally align with the **Dark Mythic Struggle** tone (Grim Hollow/Steinhardt's synergy).

**ACDA Audit Note:**
1. This registry is a **procedural lookup table**.
2. If the user discovers a "Lost Library," the Runner AI checks this table and loads `/campaign/adventures/lost_library.json` (if available) or generates content using the title as a theme.
3. Modules marked **SYNERGY** are prioritized for random world-events to maintain the Dark Mythic tone.
